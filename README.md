# Smart-Combination-Lock

<img src="overview.png" alt="overview" width="50%"> 

This project implements a smart combination lock system with enhanced security features. It includes **password input and verification, encrypted storage, anti-brute force protection, and alarm triggering via sound and bluetooth**. The system is designed using VHDL, with key modules like **segment display, timer, button debounce, buzzer, bluetooth, encryption, and decryption**. Simulation and testing confirm reliable operation and robustness. This modular hardware-based approach demonstrates a feasible secure locking mechanism.
